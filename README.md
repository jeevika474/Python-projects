Random Password Generator
This Python project is a Random Password Generator that allows users to create both strong and weak passwords based on their preferences. Users can specify the number of letters, numbers, and special characters they want in their password, and the program will generate a unique password accordingly.

FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT
1)Generate Strong Passwords:
      Create complex, secure passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
      
2)Generate Weak Passwords: 
       Create simpler passwords that are easier to remember, with fewer or no special characters.
       
3)User-Defined Length:
        Customize the length and composition of the password by specifying the number of letters, numbers, and special characters.
